# Bracken Pack, with suggested Features
what it says on the tin

This is NOT the Official Bracken Pack development GitHub, and is NOT a fork of it either. This is just a github with files extracted from the .zip releases of the bracken pack where I add code that implements suggested features. Nothing else.

## Total list of suggestions:
- [ ] Crystal cave explorer map
- [ ] species book hover text
- [ ] brine portal map
- [ ] guaranteed portal keys
- [ ] new hunter foods
- [X] water breathing allows netherkins & enderlings to enter water
- [ ] beanstalk structure from overworld -> fae
- [X] rpg titles 
- [X] [hunter-foods](https://github.com/unholy-codeism/BPSuggestedFeatures/tree/hunter-foods)
